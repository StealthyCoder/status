## CI Failures in AWS

**NOTE** - This is an ongoing issue. We still have a limited number of
customers who's LmP builds are done in AWS us-east-1 that may see intermittent issues.

* **23:00 UTC(*April 5*)** - See a CI run fail with network connectivity issues
* **11:00 UTC** - Increased number of CI failures
* **12:00 UTC** - Problems isolated to CI runs inside AWS's us-east-2 region
* **16:00 UTC** - Experiment with moving from AWS NAT Gateway
* **17:00 UTC** - Problem persists - has nothing to do with NAT Gateway
* **17:30 UTC** - Move to stand up container build infrastructure in us-west-1
* **20:30 UTC** - Tests in us-west-1 look promising.
* **21:00 UTC** - All containers builds are moved from us-east-1 and into us-west-1 and online.net
* **04:00 UTC(*April 7*)** - LmP builds are much more stable. us-east-1 is showing connection timeouts, but these patches have dramatically reduced the frequency:
